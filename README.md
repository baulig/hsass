hSass is a Haskell wrapper over [hLibsass]. It gives you a higher-level API for compilation of [Sass] files and easy integration into Haskell applications. It is meant to be simple in use yet provide as much functionality as it can.

It is available on [Hackage].

Check out the [hLibsass' README] if you find a problem with the library, as it may be related to the bindings, not hSass itself.

### Documentation

All of the documentation is in code. If you want to read a quick-start guide, check [Sass.hs] or visit [Hackage docs] for more readable format.

### Running tests

This library uses [Hspec] as a testing framework (with `hspec-discover` to generate main file). To run test suite, do:

    stack test
